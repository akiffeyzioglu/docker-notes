# ðŸ”· Personal Docker Notes / Codes / Experience 
## General Commands:

`FROM`: Indicates from which base image the image to be created will be created. It is the only command that must be in the dockerfile file.

`RUN`: If there is a command that needs to be run in Shell while creating the image, it is written with RUN.

`WORKDIR`: Used to change directory. The only difference with the cd command is that the directory is created if it doesn't exist.

`COPY`: Copies file into image.

`ADD`: Adds a file in the image.

`ARG`: Allows to take arguments while the image is being built.

`EXPOSE`: It is specified with EXPOSE on which ports the containers to be created from this image will be broadcast.

`CMD`: When the container is created from this image, the command to be run by default is written.

`HEALTHCHECK`: With this command, it can be checked whether the container is running or not.

`ENV`: Enables the definition of environment variable.

`LABEL`: This command adds metadata inside the Dockerfile.

`ADD` and `COPY` Difference

`ADD` and `COPY` perform the same functions, but ADD also ensures that the file source is the URL.

If a .tar file is specified with `ADD`, this archive is copied to the image by `untar`.

`ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` Difference

`ENTRYPOINT`, like `CMD`, cannot be changed after the image is created.

If both commands are written, what is written in the `CMD` command is added to `ENTRYPOINT` as parameters.

## Docker Commands:
### General
`docker version`: You can find out your version of docker with this command.

`docker info`: It allows you to see the containers and other system information on your system.

### Container
`docker ps`: Lists running containers.

`docker ps -a`: List all containers found in the system.

`docker container ls -a`: Functions the same as "docker ps -a".

`docker container ls -aq`: Lists the ID of all containers in the system.

`docker run --name hello-world hello-world`: Runs a container named hello-world.

`docker start hello-world`: Starts the container named hello-world.

`docker stop hello-world`: Stops the container named hello-world.

`docker logs hello-world`: Displays the logs of the container named hello-world.

`docker cp "container-id or container-name"`: path host_path: Copies file from container to host whose name or ID is given.

`docker run -d -p 8080: 80 "image-name"`: Can be run by giving the port number of the executed container. 8080 indicates the port of the host, 80 indicates the port of the container. Continuous operation is provided with "-d".

`docker run -dit "image-name" sh: "-dit"` command is a combination of -d -it -tty. Container runs in the background adding interactivity and so-called terminal connectivity.

`docker run -dit --net "network-name" "image-name" sh`: Creates a container with the created network.

`docker exec -it "container_id" sh`: It allows us to connect to the remote container with a shell connection.

`docker top "container name or id`: Indicates which processes are running in the container.

`docker run --rm -it hello-world sh`: Runs the container. `--rm` means delete after container is closed. `-it` is a combination of `--interactive` and `--tty`. Container makes interactive connections. With `sh` it also adds a terminal connection to the gasketinera on the remote machine. `--rm` only happens when the container is running interactively. With `-d` (detach), we can't say it should work in the background.

`docker stats "container name or id"`: Indicates how much resources the running container is using.

`docker attach "container-name or id"`: Used to connect to a container running in the background.

`docker run -d --cpus = "1.5" "image-name"`: It allows to use 1.5 of the processor cores in the system.

`docker run -d --cpuset-cpus = "1,4" "image-name"`: It enables the processor in the system to use processors 1 and 4.

`docker run --env deg1 = test "image-name"`: defines an environment variable named deg1.

`docker container rm "container name or id"`: Deletes the container whose name or ID is given.

`docker container rm -f "container name or id"`: Deletes the container whose name or ID is given even while it is running.

`docker container prune`: Deletes all non-working containers.

`docker system prune`: Cleans all unused containers, unused networks, unused images and build caches on the system.
